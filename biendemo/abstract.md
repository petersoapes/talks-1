One of the many facets of open science is software tools.
Various aspects of software - what we use, how we use it, and the quality of
those tools - are important for the open science movement. Open source software
is increasingly dominant in academia, making it possible to share all aspects
of a research project. However, software has generally taken a backseat to other
scholarly outputs in academia. To make open science possible, open software tools
are required for all parts of the research process: writing, data access, data
sharing, statistics, vizualization, and more. Given the lack of attention to
software in academia, the way we make and use software has room for improvement.
I'll cover how rOpenSci is addressing tooling for open science, highlight
success stories, and where we have work to do.
